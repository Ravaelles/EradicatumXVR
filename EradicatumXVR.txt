Fsctory / HQ -> build, but nothing happens. WHY THE FUCK?!?



Use highground near base
Mine other bases

buildings NOT RE BUILDED IF BUILDER DEAD

- make wounded marines run to medics, but avoid enemies

# - Modify maximum distance from bunker allowed, to be as much, as enemy max range or 4 or sumfin


- Tank escape  to the bunker, and then just stood there, waiting to be killed





WORKERS is slow, why?






- Explorer should attack always closest unit (worker?)






scv should avoid cannons, didnt

! Explorer doesnt explore unknown base locations
- Vulture doesnt run from enemies







+ Fire concentration on one unit
