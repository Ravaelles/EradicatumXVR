=========================

   This is AI for StarCraft: Brood War. It has been created in Java, using JNIBWAPI in version 0.3.7, using BWAPI 4.0.1. It comes as an entire Eclipse project.   
   
    To run it, follow instructions at: http://sscaitournament.com/index.php?action=tutorial
It should be easy to run if you follow these great instructions. To inject this code into StarCraft (in other words: so the bot can play the game) you'll need ChaosLauncher and you'll find all instructions necessary in the tutorial above. Once you follow provided (and very good) readme file (in the JNIBWAPI Starter Pack) it shoudln't be hard. But you must have at least minimal experience with Eclipse.


What AI does. Well, basically all it can to win. 
Which is:
   + Extensive initial microeconomy and defense against early attacks
   + Initially is building bunkers and marines, then Vultures and Tanks
   + Initial SCV that scouts around enemy base (trololo!)
   + Units run from the enemy units to avoid getting killed
   + Usage of Valkyries for some anti-air power
